# MyReads Project

This is the Udacity MyReads project, which is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. From the search screen, which is accessible by clicking on the plus "+" at the bottom right hand side of the screen, you can search and add books to your bookshelf.
(Note: see SEARCH_TERMS.md for available search terms).
